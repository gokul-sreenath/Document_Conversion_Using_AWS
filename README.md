# Document_Conversion_Using_AWS
The project constructs a dispersed graphical image text recognition system which can manage several local applications controlled from a multi-threaded central management application. In the case when the application manager's main thread accepts the app, it creates such app's dedicated worker threads and takes care of worker creation, image URL distribution and result collection. It is also responsible for local apps' interaction and for finishing actions when receiving stop command. The system is constructed to be tolerant â€“ one client is used for each AWS service, and tasks are distributed to worker pools using asynchronous methods and queues. Users are connected by caching their credentials on the device and by passing IAM role permissions on initialization of the instance. Data is made in a way that every local app has an ID of the app which links to its AWS resources. The movement of data is managed through S3 buckets and SQS queues. Failure management ensures that even in the event that an isolated working task encounter failure and can be assigned to a applicable working task's other workers and the broken task, machine are restarted. This architecture delivers effective performance, extensibility and good error management of image OCR operations.
